        The aim of this project is to build a system that assists doctors, covid patients and care takers of covid patients to get their medicines with less human interactions.
        In the current scenario where everything is done in online mode it is necessary to make people less contact with each other.
        This project helps in people contacting lesser. There will be a login system for patients/care takers, doctors and pharmacists. 
        In this application initially the patient can consult to a doctor after consultation the doctor can prescribe the medicine.
        Once the prescription is ready it immediately sends the copy to the local pharmacy (pharmacy inside the hospital), patient or care taker. 
        The application checks the stock of medicines and waiting time to deliver the medicine.
